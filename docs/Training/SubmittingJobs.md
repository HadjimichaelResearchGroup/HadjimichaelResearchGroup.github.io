## Submitting Jobs
*Note: this training assumes you've completed the "Getting Started with ROAR Collab" training*

At the most rudimentary level, our interest in ROAR Collab comes from a desire to take advantage of the **cluster** to do work that we would otherwise be unable to do, either because of (memory) space or (execution) time constraints. Doing work on ROAR Collab requires the submission of a **job**, which is simply just the "formal" ask to perform a computational task. [Penn State's ICDS has an entire section of ROAR Collab dedicated to submitting jobs](https://www.icds.psu.edu/submitting-jobs-on-roar-collab/), so please review this link.

There are two primary methods of running jobs with the [SLURM Workload Manager (formerly the "Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management")](https://slurm.schedmd.com/):
1. [Interactively](https://www.icds.psu.edu/running-interactive-jobs-on-roar-collab/). Please be mindful to only execute scripts or submit a job from an interactive node. The default (submit) node that you are brought to after connecting to Penn State's cluster is not suitable for scripting and scheduling batch jobs.
2. [via Batch Scheduling](https://www.icds.psu.edu/running-batch-jobs-on-roar-collab/)

[We've put together a more in-depth training presentation on jobs at this link.](https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/azh5924_psu_edu/Documents/Hadjimichael%20Group%20Materials/Training/Joining%20and%20Using%20the%20Cluster/JobTraining.pptx?d=w57c2beba60174af39d0d4ae715be4176&csf=1&web=1&e=ip2xww)
The Roar Collab team has also developed a training on data management in the Cluster. Find it [here.](https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/azh5924_psu_edu/Documents/Hadjimichael%20Group%20Materials/Training/Joining%20and%20Using%20the%20Cluster/data_management_slides.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=wfBqLu)
