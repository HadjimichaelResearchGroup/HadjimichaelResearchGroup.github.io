Example .bib entry:

@article{example2024,
  author  = {Jose da Silva},
  title   = {An Example Article},
  journal = {Journal of Examples},
  year    = {2024},
  volume  = {1},
  number  = {1},
  pages   = {1-10},
}

3. Cite References: Use the \cite{} command to cite references in your document.
Example: According to \cite{example2024}, this is an example of a citation.
