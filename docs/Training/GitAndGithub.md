## Git and Github Training

### What is Git?
Git is a tool which helps track different versions of projects while they are being developed and edited. This is known as **Version Control**. Version control helps you keep your work organized and keep track of changes you've made. It also allows collaborators or other individuals to understand your work. 

### What is GitHub?
[Github](https://github.com) is a place to keep all your code. It is a 'hub' for you and your collaborators to access and work on code and shared files. Github can be accessed online or through a desktop app.

### A Little More Detail
Within Github, files are collected and organized by **repositories**. Git had a 'local repository', which lives on each contributors' individual computer. Once edits are made locally, they are **comitted** to the remote repository. The remote repository is hosten on a server and contains the most updated versions of the code, as well as the history of changes made and much more. This functionality can all be accessed through your development environment (ie: pycharm, visual studio), or through the **command line**. The command line is a way to interact with your computer via typed 'commands'. The tutorial provides more information on this tool.

### *Gitting* Started
We've compiled some instructions for getting started with git and github [here](https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/azh5924_psu_edu/Documents/Hadjimichael%20Group%20Materials/Training/Git%20and%20Github/Updated%20Foundations%20of%20git%20and%20GitHub.pptx?d=w35e01b106873456fa3b11b5b409fc002&csf=1&web=1&e=vvJYhx). Additionally, git and github are very well documented and you can find lots of trainings online. We recommend [this tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners), and [this tool](https://learngitbranching.js.org) as good ways to get started learning and practicing.
