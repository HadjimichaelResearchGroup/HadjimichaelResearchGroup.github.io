## Reimbursements and Expensing

### Is This Something I Have To Do?
Long story short: yes. By virtue of being in graduate school, you will eventually attend a conference and need to be reimbursed for travel, or purchase something related to your research and need to have it expensed to a particular grant. This section provides some resources to help you do so.

### Helpful Information and Links
* [Refer to this most recent documentation about Department Travel Guidelines](https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/personal/azh5924_psu_edu/Documents/Hadjimichael%20Group%20Materials/TRAVEL%20Guidelines.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=aEdWrW). It covers what to do before you travel, who to use to book travel, what receipts to keep, where to find per diem rates, and what information is necessary for reimbursement after the event, and more.
* When submitting documentation, combine all PDFs into a single document. Submitting multiple files is fine *if* the each file is a unique type (one .xlsx, one .pdf, one .docx, etc). Obviously if there is a good reason to include two .docx files that's fine, but use your judgment and err on the side of fewer files.
* Having the grant's account (IO) number readily available before making the request will expedite needing to communicate with the graduate school or your advisor for it.
