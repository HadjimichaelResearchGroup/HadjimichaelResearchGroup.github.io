## Software Onboarding

As a computational modeling group, The Hadjimichael lab uses a suite of university-provided software to perform our research. This software is either provided to you by Penn State at no cost, or can be found online as open-source/free products. [The page with all available PSU-provided software can be found by clicking here.](https://softwarerequest.psu.edu/Home/Index). 

### PSU-Provided Software
- Adobe Create Cloud (specifically, Acrobat and Illustrator)
- ArcGIS and QGIS
- GlobalProtect VPN (in case you need to access PSU's network remotely)
- Globus file manager (for interacting with PSU's high performance computing cluster in a GUI as opposed to the terminal)

### Open-Source and Free Products
- python and PyCharm
- R
- Zotero and its Chrome plugin (for reference management)
- Zenodo (for creating a DOI for your work)
