## Software Onboarding

As a computational modeling group, The Hadjimichael lab uses a suite of university-provided software to perform our research. This software is either provided to you by Penn State at no cost, or can be found online as open-source/free products. [The page with all available PSU-provided software can be found by clicking here](https://softwarerequest.psu.edu/Home/Index). These lists are not exhaustive as you will likely use specialized software for your research.

### PSU-Provided Software

-   Adobe Create Cloud (specifically, Acrobat and Illustrator)
-   ArcGIS and QGIS
-   GlobalProtect VPN (in case you need to access PSU's network remotely)
-   Globus file manager (for interacting with PSU's high performance computing cluster in a GUI as opposed to the terminal)

### Open-Source and Free Products
